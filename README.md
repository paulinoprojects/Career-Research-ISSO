# Trade/Tool Study eMass

#### What is eMass?
- eMASS stands for "Enterprise Mission Assurance Support Service". 

- It is a web-based software application developed by the United States Department of Defense (DoD) to help manage the process of assessing, authorizing, and monitoring DoD information systems for compliance with security standards and requirements.

- eMASS provides a centralized platform for system owners, security assessors, and authorizing officials to collaborate on the system authorization process. It includes features for managing documentation, conducting risk assessments, testing security controls, developing Plans of Actions and Milestones (POA&Ms), and generating reports.

- eMASS is designed to streamline the security authorization process, improve collaboration between stakeholders, and ensure that DoD information systems meet established security standards and requirements. It is an important tool for achieving and maintaining compliance with the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) and other security regulations.

## General Work Flow
1. System owner initiates a new system authorization package in eMASS.
2. Security assessors conduct a risk assessment and develop a Security Assessment Plan (SAP) in eMASS.
3. Security assessors conduct security testing and document results in eMASS.
4. Security assessors develop a Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M) to address any identified vulnerabilities and risks in eMASS.
5. System owner and security assessors update the System Security Plan (SSP) and Security Controls Matrix (SCM) in eMASS.
6. System owner submits the authorization package to the Authorizing Official (AO) for review and approval in eMASS.
7. Authorizing Official approves the package and grants an Authorization to Operate (ATO) in eMASS.
8. System owner implements the security controls and ongoing monitoring activities required by the ATO, documenting all changes and updates in eMASS.
9. System owner and security assessors review and update the authorization package and supporting documentation annually or as needed to maintain compliance in eMASS.


## Key Terminology
- Security Assessment Plan (SAP): A SAP is a document that outlines the scope, objectives, and methods for conducting a security assessment of an information system. It includes details on the types of security controls to be tested, the assessment procedures to be used, and the criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of the controls. An example of a SAP for eMASS might include sections on vulnerability scanning, penetration testing, and compliance with security standards.

- Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M): A POA&M is a document that lists the actions required to address any identified vulnerabilities or deficiencies in an information system's security controls. It includes details on the specific actions to be taken, the responsible parties, and the deadlines for completion. An example of a POA&M in eMASS might include actions to patch software vulnerabilities, implement additional access controls, and improve incident response procedures.

- Security Controls Matrix (SCM): A SCM is a document that lists all the security controls required for an information system to comply with relevant security standards and regulations. It includes details on the specific controls, how they are implemented, and how they are tested and monitored. An example of an SCM in eMASS might include controls related to access management, cryptography, and incident response.

- Authorization Packages: An authorization package is a collection of documents and information related to the assessment, authorization, and ongoing monitoring of an information system's security. It includes the System Security Plan (SSP), SAP, POA&M, and SCM, as well as any supporting documentation, such as vulnerability assessments and security test results. An example of an authorization package in eMASS might include all of these documents and information, as well as any communication and approval records from the relevant stakeholders involved in the authorization process.

## Guidelines for using eMASS for audits:

Plan your audit carefully.
Before you start your audit, take some time to plan it out. 
  - This will help you to ensure that you are efficient and effective.
Set clear goals and objectives.
  - What do you hope to achieve with your audit?
Once you know your goals, you can develop a plan to achieve them.
  - Identify the scope of your audit.
What systems or processes will you be auditing?
  - It is important to define the scope of your audit so that you can stay focused.
Gather evidence.
  - Once you have identified the scope of your audit, you need to gather evidence.
  - This evidence can be in the form of documents, interviews, or observations.
Analyze the evidence.
  - Once you have gathered evidence, you need to analyze it.
  - This will help you to identify any areas of concern.
Report your findings.
  - Once you have analyzed the evidence, you need to report your findings.
  - Your report should be clear, concise, and objective.
Follow up on your findings.
  - Once you have reported your findings, you need to follow up on them.
  - This will help you to ensure that any areas of concern are addressed.
