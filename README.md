# Trade/Tool Study eMass

#### What is eMass?
- eMASS stands for "Enterprise Mission Assurance Support Service". 

- It is a web-based software application developed by the United States Department of Defense (DoD) to help manage the process of assessing, authorizing, and monitoring DoD information systems for compliance with security standards and requirements.

- eMASS provides a centralized platform for system owners, security assessors, and authorizing officials to collaborate on the system authorization process. It includes features for managing documentation, conducting risk assessments, testing security controls, developing Plans of Actions and Milestones (POA&Ms), and generating reports.

- eMASS is designed to streamline the security authorization process, improve collaboration between stakeholders, and ensure that DoD information systems meet established security standards and requirements. It is an important tool for achieving and maintaining compliance with the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) and other security regulations.
